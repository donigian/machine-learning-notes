Gradient Descent 
need to choose alpha
needs many iterations 
works well even for large n (10^6)

Normal Equation
no need to choose alpha
don't need to iterate
need to compute pinv(X^T X) 
slow if n is large, 10^6

If X^T X is non-invertible...
+ redundant features x1=(2.1)^2 x2
+ too many features, delete some features or use regularization
